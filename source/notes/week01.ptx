      <title>Welcome to the Generous Arena</title>
      
      <p>
        In <pubtitle><url href="https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~pjmaddy/bio/What%20do%20we%20want%20-%20final">What do we want a 
        foundation to do?</url></pubtitle> (2019), Penelope Maddy argues that set theory forms a Generous Arena for mathematics: 
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            a unified setting with a Shared Standard of Proof, and a Meta-mathematical Corral so that formal techniques can 
            be applied to all of mathematics at once.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        As interesting and alive as they are, we won't pursue questions of foundations in this course. But I want to argue 
        that <alert>topology</alert> is a Generous Arena for all — or at least nearly all — things geometric in mathematics. 
        Given a mere whiff of geometry, some sense of closeness or continuity or paths, topology is lurking and the experience 
        and labor of generations of mathematicians has revealed that the formalism of topology offers a common language in 
        which these notions can be captured and made precise.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is somewhat at odds with the common conception of topology as "rubber sheet geometry" — a coffee cup is the same 
        as a donut! the Möbius strip only has one side! Euler's formula for planar graphs! Khovanov homology distinguishes the 
        unknot! These are fine, even wonderful, topics and results, and we will discuss some of them in due course. But they 
        do poor service in capturing the stunning breadth and extreme utility of topology in contemporary mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this claim concrete, here is an incomplete list of settings in which topological ideas (spaces, 
        continuity, compactness, connectedness, homotopy, homology, and their descendants) function as a shared language:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Manifolds and singular spaces.</em> Smooth manifolds, manifolds with boundary, orbifolds, and stratified 
            spaces; the passage from local geometry to global invariants; and the basic fact that many geometric problems 
            are really problems about how local pieces glue.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Configuration and moduli spaces.</em> Spaces of points in a manifold, spaces of embeddings, and moduli of 
            geometric structures; topology keeps track of how parameters vary continuously, and it detects global features 
            that no coordinate chart can see.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Algebraic geometry and its avatars.</em> Schemes as locally ringed topological spaces, complex varieties 
            viewed as topological spaces, étale/profinite shadows of spaces, and the way cohomology packages intersection 
            data and subtle “hidden” structure.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Category theory as geometry.</em> Categories as spaces (via nerves and classifying spaces), higher categories 
            as higher-dimensional geometry, and the guiding principle that “equivalence” is often the right notion of sameness.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Dynamics and flows.</em> Long-term behavior of iterated processes and differential equations; attractors, 
            recurrence, and qualitative features that persist under perturbation.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Combinatorics with geometry inside.</em> Graphs, posets, and simplicial complexes; topological invariants 
            that constrain what combinatorial objects can exist and how they must behave.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Topological data analysis.</em> Turning point clouds into simplicial complexes and extracting stable, 
            noise-robust features; using homology as a kind of geometric summary statistic.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Physics and symmetry.</em> Spaces of fields, gauge symmetry, and phase spaces; invariants arising from 
            quantization and from the topology of symmetry actions.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Computation and invariants.</em> Algorithms that compute topological signatures; the practical question of 
            which invariants are computable and what they reveal (and conceal) about geometric input.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Arithmetic geometry.</em> Number theory has its own natural topologies: the <alert>profinite Galois group</alert> 
            <m>\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{K}/K)</m> assembled from finite quotients, the <alert><m>p</m>-adic integers</alert> <m>\mathbb{Z}_p</m>, 
            and the <alert>adeles</alert> <m>\mathbb{A}_K</m>, where “closeness” is measured <m>p</m>-adically and via local-global structure.
          </p>
        </li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Our aim in this course is to build enough of the basic toolkit to recognize these phenomena when they appear, and 
        to compute invariants that remain meaningful when coordinates, metrics, and other rigid structures are unavailable 
        (or irrelevant).

      <title>So what is a topology?</title>
      <p>
        Whatever a topology is, it is should specify a notion of convergent sequences. That is, if <m>X</m> is a topological 
        space (to be defined in due course) and <m>x\colon \mathbb{N}\to X</m> is a sequence in <m>X</m>, then the statement 
        "the limit of <m>x</m> is <m>L</m>" should make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now if <m>X = \mathbb{R}^n</m> is Euclidean space, we know what this means:
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            for all <m>\varepsilon>0</m> there exists <m>N\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>n>N</m> implies 
            <m>d(x_n,L) \lt \varepsilon</m>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        where <m>d</m> is the standard distance function on <m>\mathbb R^n</m>. If we focus on the role of <m>d</m>, we'll 
        arrive at the notion of a metric space, which is not where we're headed presently. Instead, write 
        <m>B(L,\varepsilon)</m> for the ball of points in <m>\mathbb R^n</m> distance less than <m>\varepsilon</m> from <m>L</m>. 
        We can then recast convergence of <m>x</m> to <m>L</m> as 
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            for all <m>\varepsilon>0</m> there exists <m>N\in\mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>n>N</m> implies 
            <m>x_n\in B(L,\varepsilon)</m>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        or
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            for every ball <m>B</m> centered at <m>L</m> there exists <m>N\in\mathbb N</m> such that <m>n\gt N</m> implies 
            <m>x_n\in B</m>.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        This suggests that a topology on <m>X</m> might be specified by a <term>basis</term> <m>\mathscr B</m> of subsets of <m>X</m> 
        with similar properties to those of open balls in <m>\mathbb R^n</m>.

            Mathematicians make a tremendous fuss about precision in language and then break all their rules when defining

            indicates that the language to the right of :iff provides a specification for the object on the left. We will use

      This leads us to the notion of a <term>topology</term> on a set.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>topology</term> on a set <m>X</m> is a collection of subsets <m>\tau\subseteq 2^X</m> (called 
          <term>open sets</term>) that is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. A set <m>X</m> equipped 
          with a topology <m>\tau</m> is called a <term>topological space</term>. We will often abuse notation and write

      <title>On a redundant axiom</title>
      <p>
        Some authors further specify that <m>\varnothing</m> and <m>X</m> are open (that is, elements of <m>\tau</m>). 
        Since <m>\bigcup \varnothing = \varnothing</m> and <m>\bigcap \varnothing = X</m> (when taking intersections of 
        subsets of <m>X</m>), these conditions actually follow from closure under unions and finite intersections.

      We have seen that every basis induces a topology by declaring the open sets to be unions of basis sets. It is also the 
      case that every topology is a basis. We will now define sequence convergence with respect to a topology, and it will be your 
      task to confirm that convergence with respect to a basis is the same thing as convergence with respect to the topology induced

      <title>Examples of topologies</title>
      <p>
        It is now our lot to recite some fundamental examples of topologies. Of course, you won't really have a feel for these 
        until you start working with topological spaces, but we have to start somewhere. The careful reader will verify that each 
        example is indeed a topology (closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections).
      </p>
      <example>
        <title>Discrete topology</title>
        <p>
          The <term>discrete topology</term> on a set <m>X</m> is <m>\tau_{\text{disc}} := 2^X</m>. That is, in the discrete topology, 
          <alert>every</alert> subset of <m>X</m> is open.

      </example>
      <example>
        <title>Concrete topology</title>        
        <p>
          The <term>concrete topology</term> on a set <m>X</m> is <m>\tau_{\text{conc}} := \{\varnothing, X\}</m>. Other authors 
          sometimes call this the trivial, indiscrete, or codiscrete topology.

        <title>Sierpiński space</title>

          The <term>Sierpiński space</term> is the set <m>\mathbb 2 = \{0,1\}</m> equipped with the topology 
          <m>\tau_{\mathbb 2} := \{\varnothing,\{1\},\{0,1\}\}</m>. Note that this is <alert>not</alert> the discrete or concrete topology on 
          <m>S</m>. After developing the language of conntinuity, we will discover that for an arbitrary topological space 
          <m>X</m>, the continuous functions <m>X\to \mathbb 2</m> are in natural bijection with open subsets of <m>X</m>.

          <md>
            \tau_{\text{cof}} := \{U\subseteq X\mid \#(X\smallsetminus U)\lt \infty\} \cup \{\varnothing\}.

      <title>Continuity</title>
      <p>
        Given sets <m>X,Y</m>, we are familiar with functions <m>f\colon X\to Y</m> as a mechanism for 
        comparing <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>. If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are topological spaces, then only some functions 
        "respect" their topology; we call these <term>continuous</term> functions. Before introducing the formal definition 
        of continuity, let's motivate it in terms of familiar <m>\varepsilon</m>-<m>\delta</m> continuity:
      </p>
      <p>
        A function <m>f\colon \mathbb R\to \mathbb R</m> is continuous at a point <m>p</m> in its domain :iff
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            for all <m>\varepsilon \gt 0</m> there exists <m>\delta \gt 0</m> such that <m>|x-p|\lt\delta</m> implies 
            <m>|f(x)-f(p)|\lt\varepsilon</m>.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        We are currently interested in functions continuous everywhere, so the above condition must hold for all 
        <m>p\in \mathbb R</m>. Of course, <m>\delta</m> is permitted to depend on both <m>p</m> and <m>\varepsilon</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phrased in terms of the basic open sets of <m>\mathbb R</m>, that is, open balls, we see that for every 
        <m>p\in \mathbb R</m> and every open ball <m>B</m> centered at <m>f(p)</m>, there exists an open ball <m>C</m> 
        centered at <m>p</m> such that <m>fC\subseteq B</m>; equivalently, <m>C\subseteq f^{-1}B</m>.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          Every function <m>f\colon X\to Y</m> induces a <term>direct image</term> function <m>f\colon 2^X\to 2^Y</m> and 
          <term>preimage function</term>  <m>f^{-1}\colon 2^Y\to 2^X</m> given by <m>fA := \{f(a)\mid a\in A\}</m> 
          and <m>f^{-1}B := \{a\in X\mid f(a)\in B\}</m>.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        We can further recast <m>\varepsilon</m>-<m>\delta</m> continuity as follows:
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            for every <m>p</m> in the domain and every basic open <m>B</m> of the codomain with <m>f(p)\in B</m>, 
            there exists a basic open <m>C</m> of the domain such that <m>p\in C</m> and <m>C\subseteq f^{-1}B</m>.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        Now consider some <m>x\in f^{-1}B</m>. By continuity, there exists a basic open <m>C_x</m> of the domain for which 
        <m>x\in C_x</m> and <m>C_x\subseteq f^{-1}B</m>. From this, we may conclude that
        <md>
          f^{-1}B = \bigcup_{x\in f^{-1}B}C_x.
        </md>
        (You should check the details.) Thus <m>f^{-1}B</m> is open. Observe that every open set is a union of basic opens, 
        whence we get another equivalent condition for continuity:
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            for every basic open <m>B</m> of the codomain, <m>f^{-1}B</m> is open in the domain.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        And once again, every open is a union of basic opens, and preimage commutes with unions, we we can simply say 
        that the preimage of every open is open. This is our formal definition of continuity in the context of general 
        topological spaces:
      </p>
      <definition xml:id="def-continuity">
        <title>Continuity</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A function <m>f\colon X\to Y</m> between topological spaces is <term>continuous</term> :iff for every open 
            subset <m>V\subseteq Y</m>, the preimage <m>f^{-1}V</m> is open in <m>X</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

      <p>
        In order to develop our intuition for continuity, we'll introduce some additional terminology:

        <title>Topologies via closed sets</title>
        <p>
          Prove that the closed subsets of a topological space are closed under arbitrary intersection and finite union. 
          Then verify that a family of subsets <m>\kappa \subseteq 2^X</m> closed under arbitrary intersection and finite 
          union specifies a topology by declaring <m>U\subseteq X</m> to be open if and only if it is the complement of some 
          set in <m>\kappa</m>.
        </p>
      </exercise>
      <p>
        Since <m>\varnothing</m> and <m>X</m> are always open subsets of a topological space <m>X</m>, we see that 
        <m>X</m> and <m>\varnothing</m> are always closed subsets of <m>X</m>. In this fashion, we see that "open" 
        and "closed" are not antonyms in topology — they are properties that can be simultaneously obtained. When 
        a set is both open and closed, we may exercise questionable taste and call it <term>clopen</term>.

        <title>Compositions of continuous functions are continuous</title>

            Suppose <m>f\colon X\to Y</m> and <m>g\colon Y\to Z</m> are continuous functions between topological spaces. 
            Then the composite function <m>g\circ f\colon X\to Z</m> is continuous as well.

      </theorem>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>U\subseteq Z</m> is open. Since <m>g</m> is continuous, <m>g^{-1}U</m> is an open subset of <m>Y</m>. 
          Since <m>f</m> is continuous, <m>f^{-1}[g^{-1}U]</m> is an open subset of <m>X</m>. One may check that

            f^{-1}[g^{-1}U] = (g\circ f)^{-1}U.

        Historically, topological properties preceded topology. Mathematicians noticed that certain properties — such as 
        nonemptiness, connectedness, discreteness, and compactness — did not change under a broad class of deformations. In order 
        codify these properties, they then created the language of topology, continuity, and homeomorphisms.
