      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\mathscr B</m> denote the collection of open balls in <m>\mathbb R^n</m> (with respect to the standard 
          distance function). Prove that <m>\mathscr B</m> is a basis.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a set and suppose <m>\mathscr B\subseteq 2^X</m> is a basis. Let <m>\tau\subseteq 2^X</m> be the 
          collection of arbitrary unions of elements of <m>\mathscr B</m>. Prove that <m>\tau</m> is a topology on <m>X</m>. 
          Further prove that if <m>\tau'\supseteq \mathscr B</m> is another topology containing <m>\mathscr B</m>, then 
          <m>\tau\subseteq \tau'</m>. Thus <m>\tau</m> is the smallest (aka <term>coarsest</term>) topology on <m>X</m> 
          containing <m>\mathscr B</m>, and thus we may call <m>\tau</m> the <term>topology generated by <m>\mathscr B</m></term>.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a set, <m>\mathscr B</m> be a basis on <m>X</m>, and <m>\tau</m> be the topology generated by <m>\mathscr B</m>. 
          Show that a sequence <m>x\colon \mathbb N\to X</m> converges to <m>L\in X</m> with respect to the basis <m>\mathscr B</m> if 
          and only if it converges to <m>L\in X</m> with respect to the topology <m>\tau</m>.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Determine all topologies on the set <m>\mathbb 2 = \{0,1\}</m>. How many are there? Now do the same thing with 
          <m>\mathbb 3 = \{0,1,2\}</m>. (You should draw a picture and it should be large and glorious. How can you organize 
          your picture so that it demonstrates important relations between topologies?)
