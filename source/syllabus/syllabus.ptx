      <title>Course description</title>

      <p>
       Topology is the study of properties of spaces and maps that are invariant 
       under continuous deformation — the qualitative geometry captured by notions like 
       continuity, convergence, compactness, and connectedness rather than by distances 
       or angles. In this course we will build a rigorous foundation for these ideas 
       and then use it as a common language for a range of modern examples, with particular 
       attention to configuration spaces and moduli spaces, manifolds and their 
       local-to-global structure, and profinite spaces that arise as inverse limits and in 
       “arithmetic” topological contexts. We will also introduce homology as a first bridge 
       from point-set foundations to algebraic topology, using it to extract computable 
       invariants and to illuminate how spaces are built. Along the way we will emphasize 
       categorical perspectives — functoriality, universal properties, and adjointness — 
       as tools for organizing constructions and revealing the relationships among these 
       different kinds of spaces.

      <title>Distribution requirements</title>
      <p>
        This course can be used towards your Group III, "Natural, Mathematical, and Psychological Science," 
        requirement. It accomplishes the following goals for the group:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Use and evaluate quantitative data or modeling, or use logical/mathematical reasoning to evaluate, 
              test, or prove statements.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Given a problem or question, formulate a hypothesis or conjecture, and design an experiment, 
              collect data or use mathematical reasoning to test or validate it.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This course does <alert>not</alert> satisfy the "primary data collection and analysis" requirement.

      <title>Texts</title>
      <p>
        This course does not have an assigned textbook, but I recommend Topology (2nd ed.) by James Munkres and 
        <url href="https://topology.mitpress.mit.edu/">Topology: A Categorical Approach</url> as supplementary texts. 
        I will be writing course notes during the term which will appear on this website.
      </p>

      <title>Homework</title>
      <p>
        Homework will be posted on the course website and should be submitted via 
        <url href="https://gradescope.com/">Gradescope</url> every Friday by 10pm. Homework due Friday of week <m>N</m> 
        covers topics through Monday of week <m>N</m> and you are strongly encouraged to start the homework early in order 
        to take advantage of office hours and study groups. Excellent solutions take many forms, but they all have the 
        following characteristics:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              they are written as explanations for other students in the course; in particular, 
              they fully explain all of their reasoning and do not assume that the reader will fill in details;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              when graphical reasoning is called for, they include large, carefully drawn and labeled diagrams;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              they are neatly written or typeset; and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              they use complete sentences, even when formulas or symbols are involved.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Given the exigences of contemporary existence, students may take advantage of up to three weekend 
        extensions on homework assignments over the course of the semester. To do so, you must contact the 
        instructor <alert>before</alert> the deadline and request an extension. No explanation is needed, and 
        you will automatically receive an extension till the following Monday at 10pm. In extreme circumstances, 
        I may make additional accommodations; early and clear communication is key.
      </p>

      <title>Collaboration</title>
      <p>
        You are permitted and encouraged to work with your peers on homework problems. You must cite those 
        with whom you worked, and you must write up solutions independently. Duplicated solutions will not 
        be accepted and constitute a violation of the Honor Principle.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Feedback</title>
      <p>
        You will receive timely feedback on your homework via Gradescope, either from me or the course grader 
        (a mathematics undergraduate).  Each homework problem can earn up to <alert>five points</alert> for mathematical content, 
        and <alert>two points</alert> for the quality of writing.  If your answer is incorrect, this will be reflected in the score, 
        and there will also be a comment indicating where things went wrong with your solution.  You are strongly 
        encouraged to engage with this comment, understand your error, and try to come up with a correct solution.  
        You are very welcome to post questions about old homework problems to the Zulip workspace (see below) and talk 
        about them with me in office hours (see the Help section).

      <title>Exams</title>
      <p>
        We will have two midterm exams and a final exam. The midterm exams will be open book, open notes, and take-home.  
        They will have suggested time constraints and firm due dates, but you will be permitted to spend an arbitrary 
        amount of time on the problems between when the exam is distributed and collected.  Calculators, computers, 
        phones, collaboration, the Internet, and chat bots / AI are prohibited during exams.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final exam will be an oral exam. Questions related to those asked during the exam will be distributed 
        beforehand.

      <title>Joint expectations</title>
      <p>
        As members of a communal learning environment, we should all expect consideration, fairness, 
        patience, and curiosity from each other.  Our aim is to all learn more through cooperation and 
        genuine listening and sharing, not to compete or show off.  I expect diligence and academic and 
        intellectual honesty from each of you.  You should expect that I will do my best to focus the 
        course on interesting, pertinent topics, and that I will provide feedback and guidance which will 
        help you excel as a student.

      <title>Zulip</title>
      <p>
        This course will use a Zulip workspace for asynchronous communication. Use the Zulip workspace 
        to ask questions (of me or the class), collaborate on problems, and share resources. The Zulip 
        workspace is an extension of our classroom and the above joint expectations extend to this setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will receive an email invitation to join our Zulip workspace during the first week of classes. 
        Please use channels and threads to keep conversations organized.

      <title>Help</title>
      <p>
        Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend my <alert>office hours</alert> 13:00-14:00 Tuesday and Thursday each week. 
        These are an opportunity to discuss course content, get help on homework problems, or dig deeper into material. 
        You can also schedule a one-on-one <alert>appointment</alert> with me 
        <url href="https://calendar.notion.so/meet/kyleormsby/office">via this link</url>.

      <title>The Internet and AI</title>
      <p>
        The goal of this course is to help you think and solve problems like a mathematician. It is the instructor's opinion 
        that many uses of the Internet and most uses of AI chatbots (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) will impede 
        your progress toward this goal. I encourage you to consider your priorities as a student in this course and, 
        whenever tempted to try to look up answers or ask a chatbot, ask yourself "will this help me achieve my goals, or 
        will it short circuit the learning process?"
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not acceptable to turn in work copied from the Internet or generated by a chatbot; doing so constitutes a 
        violation of the Honor Principle. Any Internet resources or chatbot sessions used to help generate a homework 
        submission should be cited. In the case of chatbot sessions, you should include the prompt you used in your submission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure you are aware of the following two facts:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The Internet and AI chatbots are <alert>not</alert> permitted on take-home exams.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              These policies are <alert>specific to this course</alert>. Consult your other instructors and their 
              syllabi to understand if and how these resources are permitted elsewhere.
            </p>

      <title>Academic accommodations</title>
      <p>
        If you have a documented disability requiring academic accommodation, please have  Disability &amp; Accessibility 
        Resources (DAR)  provide a letter during the first week of classes.  I will then contact you to schedule a meeting 
        during which we can discuss your accommodations.  If you believe you have an undocumented disability and that 
        accommodations would ensure equal access to your Reed education, I would be happy to help you contact DAR.

      <title>Grades</title>
      <p>
        Your grade will reflect a composite assessment of the work you produce for the class, weighted in the following 
        fashion:  35% homework, 25% final exam, 20% exam 2, 15% exam 1, 5% class participation.
