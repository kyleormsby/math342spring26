      <title>Topology from the categorical viewpoint</title>
        <aside>
          <p>
            One of my favorite math books is John Milnor's <pubtitle>Topology from the differentiable viewpoint</pubtitle>, 
            which serves as inspiration for the the section title here.
          </p>
        </aside>

  <p>
    One of the primary insights of twentieth century mathematics is that <alert>objects</alert> should not be studied in
    isolation. Rather, to understand objects we must also understand <alert>relationships</alert> between objects.
    Topologies offer one notion of “relation”, organizing the points of a set into neighborhoods. As an abstraction
    of geometry, topology is immensely successful, but it fails to capture a second, more structural notion of relation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <alert>Category theory</alert> organizes objects by their transformations. Once these notions of object and relation are
    abstracted, it becomes possible to compare and contrast different fields of mathematics. Theorems about wildly
    different mathematical objects are often identical in their categorical content. In this manner, category theory
    becomes a meta-mathematical tool for both identifying and conjecturing structural results.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our present goal is to use the 
    language of category theory to motivate definitions and interpret theorems. Moving into the algebro-topological portion of the course,
    this language will become even more important as we use the homology <term>functor</term> to compare the
    categories of topological spaces and vector spaces.
  </p>

    <title>Categories</title>

    <p>
      We begin with a motivating example. Sets are a type of mathematical object. Sets are related by functions.
      Each function has a domain (source) and codomain (target). In standard notation, <m>f:A\to B</m> denotes
      a function with domain <m>A</m> and codomain <m>B</m>. Of course, functions admit composition: given
      <m>g:B\to C</m> and <m>f:A\to B</m> we can form <m>g\circ f:A\to C</m> by assigning <m>g(f(a))</m> to
      <m>a\in A</m>. This composition is associative: if <m>f:A\to B</m>, <m>g:B\to C</m>, and <m>h:C\to D</m>
      are functions, then
      <md>h\circ(g\circ f) = (h\circ g)\circ f.</md>
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, each set (even the empty set!) admits an identity function <m>\operatorname{id}_A:A\to A</m>. This function takes
      each <m>a\in A</m> to <m>a</m> and satisfies the following property: for each <m>g:A\to B</m> and each
      <m>f:C\to A</m>,
    </p>

    <p>
      <md>g\circ \operatorname{id}_A = g\qquad\text{and}\qquad \operatorname{id}_A\circ f = f.</md>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following definition, we will see that categories consist of objects, morphisms (with source and target
      objects), composition, and identity morphisms satisfying associativity and identity properties. As such, sets and
      functions form our first example of a category.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-category">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>category</term> <m>\mathcal{C}</m> consists of a collection of <term>objects</term> <m>\mathrm{Ob}\,\mathcal{C}</m>
          and a collection of <term>morphisms</term> <m>\mathrm{Mor}\,\mathcal{C}</m> along with assignments
          <m>s,t:\mathrm{Mor}\,\mathcal{C}\to \mathrm{Ob}\,\mathcal{C}</m> (called the <term>source</term> and <term>target</term> maps).
          Let <m>\mathcal{C}(x,y)\subseteq \mathrm{Mor}\,\mathcal{C}</m> denote the collection of morphisms with source
          <m>x\in \mathrm{Ob}\,\mathcal{C}</m> and target <m>y\in \mathrm{Ob}\,\mathcal{C}</m>. Then for each
          <m>x,y,z\in \mathrm{Ob}\,\mathcal{C}</m>, <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is also equipped with a <term>composition</term>
          <md>
            <mrow>\circ\colon \mathcal{C}(y,z)\times \mathcal{C}(x,y) \amp \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}(x,z)</mrow>
            <mrow>(g,f) \amp \longmapsto g\circ f.</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, for each <m>x\in \mathrm{Ob}\,\mathcal{C}</m> there is an <term>identity morphism</term>
          <m>\operatorname{id}_x\in \mathcal{C}(x,x)</m>. This data must satisfy the following properties:
        </p>

        <dl>
         <li>
           <title>Associativity:</title>
           <p>
             For objects <m>x,y,z,w</m> and morphisms <m>f\in \mathcal{C}(x,y)</m>,
             <m>g\in \mathcal{C}(y,z)</m>, and <m>h\in \mathcal{C}(z,w)</m>, we have
             <md>h\circ(g\circ f) = (h\circ g)\circ f.</md>
           </p>
         </li>
       
         <li>
            <title>Identity:</title>
            <p>
              For each <m>x,y\in \mathrm{Ob}\,\mathcal{C}</m>, <m>f\in \mathcal{C}(x,y)</m>, and
              <m>g\in \mathcal{C}(y,x)</m>, we have
              <md>f\circ \operatorname{id}_x = f\qquad\text{and}\qquad \operatorname{id}_x\circ g = g.</md>
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>

      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      It is useful to think about categories diagrammatically. These diagrams use letters to represent objects, and
      labelled arrows to represent morphisms. So if <m>x,y\in \mathrm{Ob}\,\mathcal{C}</m> and <m>f\in \mathcal{C}(x,y)</m>,
      we may draw an arrow from <m>x</m> to <m>y</m> labelled <m>f</m> in order to represent that <m>f</m> is a morphism
      with source <m>x</m> and target <m>y</m>. (Note that we have dropped <m>\mathcal{C}</m> from our notation here:
      usually it will be clear from context which category we are working in.) We may also write <m>f\colon x\to y</m> to
      represent <m>f\in \mathcal{C}(x,y)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now suppose that in addition to <m>f</m> we also have a morphism <m>g\colon y\to z</m>. Composition tells us that we then
      get a new morphism <m>g\circ f\colon x\to z</m>. We can put all of this information into a single <em>commutative diagram</em>.

    <p>
      When we say that a diagram like the one above <alert>commutes</alert>, we are saying precisely that the two paths from
      <m>x</m> to <m>z</m> determine the same morphism, i.e. the bottom arrow equals the composite of the two slanted arrows.
      The geometric presentation of the diagram is unimportant; we can rearrange the nodes without changing the meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can also use diagrams to express the axioms for a category. Associativity can be pictured as the statement that
      two different ways of composing <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>, and <m>h</m> agree.

      We can interpret this axiom as saying that we can paste together commutative triangles to produce commutative quadrilaterals.
      The identity axiom also admits a simple diagrammatic expression.

    <p>
      Without realizing it, you have been working with categories for a long time. Consider the following examples.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="eg-sets">
      <title>The category of sets and functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We have already mentioned that sets and functions form a category. We denote this category <m>\mathsf{Set}</m>.
          Similarly, there is a category <m>\mathsf{FinSet}</m> with objects finite sets and morphisms functions between finite sets.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="eg-vect">
      <title>The category of vector spaces and linear transformations</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>k</m> be a field and let <m>\mathsf{Vect}_k</m> have objects <m>k</m>-vector spaces and morphisms <m>k</m>-linear
          transformations. Since linear transformations compose (in the set-theoretic sense) to give new linear transformations,
          <m>\mathsf{Vect}_k</m> is also a category. (It is obvious that the identity function <m>1_V:V\to V</m> is linear.)
          We can also consider the category <m>\mathsf{FinVect}_k</m> of finite-dimensional <m>k</m>-vector spaces and <m>k</m>-linear
          transformations.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="eg-empty-category">
      <title>The empty category</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>empty category</term> <m>\varnothing</m> has no objects (i.e. <m>\mathrm{Ob}\,\varnothing=\varnothing</m>) and no morphisms
          (<m>\mathrm{Mor}\,\varnothing=\varnothing</m>). The source, target, and composition functions are all the empty function
          <m>\varnothing\to\varnothing</m> and all properties are satisfied vacuously!
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="eg-trivial-category">
      <title>The trivial category</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>trivial category</term> <m>\bullet</m> has a singleton set <m>\{*\}</m> for its objects and a single morphism
          (necessarily the identity on <m>*</m>), <m>\operatorname{id}_*:* \to *</m>. The only composition to define is 
          <m>\operatorname{id}_*\circ \operatorname{id}_*=\operatorname{id}_*</m> and this is enough
          to check the associativity and identity properties as well.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="eg-mat">
      <title>A category whose morphisms are not functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Not every category has special classes of functions as morphisms. Consider <m>\mathsf{Mat}_k</m> whose objects are the natural numbers
          <m>\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}</m> and whose morphisms <m>\mathsf{Mat}_k(m,n)</m> are <m>n\times m</m> matrices with entries in a field
          <m>k</m>. Composition is given by matrix multiplication (check compatibility!) and <m>\operatorname{id}_k</m> is the <m>k\times k</m> 
          identity matrix. 
          Since matrix multiplication is associative, this forms a category.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are suspicious that this category is eerily similar to <m>\mathsf{FinVect}_k</m>, worry not: it is! After studying equivalences of
          categories and skeleta, you will understand exactly how similar.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      The following two examples should seem completely obvious if you have already taken a course in abstract algebra. If you have not, there is no harm
      in skipping them.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="eg-groups">
      <title>Categories of groups</title>
      
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are categories <m>\mathsf{Gp}</m>, <m>\mathsf{FinGp}</m>, and <m>\mathsf{AbGp}</m> of groups, finite groups, and Abelian groups,
          respectively. In each case, morphisms are group homomorphisms.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="eg-rings">
      <title>Categories of rings</title>
      
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are categories <m>\mathsf{Ring}</m> and <m>\mathsf{CommRing}</m> of rings and commutative rings, respectively. In both cases,
          morphisms are ring homomorphisms. There is also a category <m>\mathsf{Field}</m> of fields and field homomorphisms.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      Finally, we come to the category of primary interest in this course, the category of topological spaces and continuous functions.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="eg-top">
      <title>The category of topological spaces and continuous functions</title>
      
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          The category <m>\mathsf{Top}</m> has topological spaces as its objects and continuous functions as its morphisms. In order to check this, we must
          see that the composition of continuous functions is continuous and that identity functions are continuous. If <m>X</m> is a topological space and
          <m>\operatorname{id}_X:X\to X</m> is the identity function, then for any <m>U\subseteq X</m> open, <m>\operatorname{id}_X^{-1}(U)=U</m> is open in 
          <m>X</m>, so <m>\operatorname{id}\operatorname{id}_X</m> is continuous. The associativity and identity axioms hold because they hold for functions.

      <title>Choice of morphisms</title>
      <p>
        Of course, there is also a category whose objects are topological spaces and morphisms are arbitrary functions between underlying sets. And while we are
        free to define such a category, it is not of particular interest. A category is a tool for studying relationships between objects. If we choose the wrong
        set of relationships (i.e. the wrong morphisms), then we end up with an uninteresting — or, worse yet, misleading — category.
