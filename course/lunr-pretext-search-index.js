Class meetings  MWF 14:40-15:30 in Eliot 207    Office hours  Tu 13:00-14:00 & Th 14:30-15:30 in Lib 306 and by appointment     Zulip workspace   math342-2026.zulipchat.com        Course description  Topology is the study of properties of spaces and maps that are invariant under continuous deformation — the qualitative geometry captured by notions like continuity, convergence, compactness, and connectedness rather than by distances or angles. In this course we will build a rigorous foundation for these ideas and then use it as a common language for a range of modern examples, with particular attention to configuration spaces and moduli spaces, manifolds and their local-to-global structure, and profinite spaces that arise as inverse limits and in “arithmetic” topological contexts. We will also introduce homology as a first bridge from point-set foundations to algebraic topology, using it to extract computable invariants and to illuminate how spaces are built. Along the way we will emphasize categorical perspectives — functoriality, universal properties, and adjointness — as tools for organizing constructions and revealing the relationships among these different kinds of spaces.    Learning outcomes  Here are the overarching goals of the course:   Converse in the languages of topology and category theory.    Utilize universal properties and concrete constructions to define mathematical objects and manipulate them.    Understand and utilize theorems and concepts from topology such as connectedness, compactness, Hausdorffness, Tychonoff's theorem, one-point and Stone-Čech compactifications, homology, and Mayer-Vietoris sequence.    Understand and utilize theorems and concepts from category theory such as functors, natural transformations, the Yoneda lemma, (co)limits, and adjunctions.    Understand and produce proofs related to the above topics.    Apply the above topics in relevant examples and applications.    Communicate mathematical ideas verbally and in writing.       Distribution requirements  This course can be used towards your Group III, \"Natural, Mathematical, and Psychological Science,\" requirement. It accomplishes the following goals for the group:   Use and evaluate quantitative data or modeling, or use logical\/mathematical reasoning to evaluate, test, or prove statements.    Given a problem or question, formulate a hypothesis or conjecture, and design an experiment, collect data or use mathematical reasoning to test or validate it.     This course does not satisfy the \"primary data collection and analysis\" requirement.    Texts  This course does not have an assigned textbook, but I recommend Topology (2nd ed.) by James Munkres and Topology: A Categorical Approach as supplementary texts. I will be writing course notes during the term which will appear on this website.    Homework  Homework will be posted on the course website and should be submitted via Gradescope every Friday by 10pm. Homework due Friday of week covers topics through Monday of week and you are strongly encouraged to start the homework early in order to take advantage of office hours and study groups. Excellent solutions take many forms, but they all have the following characteristics:   they are written as explanations for other students in the course; in particular, they fully explain all of their reasoning and do not assume that the reader will fill in details;    when graphical reasoning is called for, they include large, carefully drawn and labeled diagrams;    they are neatly written or typeset; and    they use complete sentences, even when formulas or symbols are involved.   Given the exigences of contemporary existence, students may take advantage of up to three weekend extensions on homework assignments over the course of the semester. To do so, you must contact the instructor before the deadline and request an extension. No explanation is needed, and you will automatically receive an extension till the following Monday at 10pm. In extreme circumstances, I may make additional accommodations; early and clear communication is key.    Collaboration  You are permitted and encouraged to work with your peers on homework problems. You must cite those with whom you worked, and you must write up solutions independently. Duplicated solutions will not be accepted and constitute a violation of the Honor Principle.    Feedback  You will receive timely feedback on your homework via Gradescope, either from me or the course grader (a mathematics undergraduate). Each homework problem can earn up to five points for mathematical content, and two points for the quality of writing. If your answer is incorrect, this will be reflected in the score, and there will also be a comment indicating where things went wrong with your solution. You are strongly encouraged to engage with this comment, understand your error, and try to come up with a correct solution. You are very welcome to post questions about old homework problems to the Zulip workspace (see below) and talk about them with me in office hours (see the Help section).    Exams  We will have two midterm exams and a final exam. The midterm exams will be open book, open notes, and take-home. They will have suggested time constraints and firm due dates, but you will be permitted to spend an arbitrary amount of time on the problems between when the exam is distributed and collected. Calculators, computers, phones, collaboration, the Internet, and chat bots \/ AI are prohibited during exams.  The final exam will be an oral exam. Questions related to those asked during the exam will be distributed beforehand.   Midterm Exam 1  TBD    Midterm Exam 2  TBD    Final Exam  Individual 30-minute time slots scheduled during finals week, May 11-14.       Joint expectations  As members of a communal learning environment, we should all expect consideration, fairness, patience, and curiosity from each other. Our aim is to all learn more through cooperation and genuine listening and sharing, not to compete or show off. I expect diligence and academic and intellectual honesty from each of you. You should expect that I will do my best to focus the course on interesting, pertinent topics, and that I will provide feedback and guidance which will help you excel as a student.    Zulip  This course will use a Zulip workspace for asynchronous communication. Use the Zulip workspace to ask questions (of me or the class), collaborate on problems, and share resources. The Zulip workspace is an extension of our classroom and the above joint expectations extend to this setting.  You will receive an email invitation to join our Zulip workspace during the first week of classes. Please use channels and threads to keep conversations organized.    Help  Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend my office hours 13:00-14:00 Tuesday and Thursday each week. These are an opportunity to discuss course content, get help on homework problems, or dig deeper into material. You can also schedule a one-on-one appointment with me via this link .  Additionally, every Reed student is entitled to one hour of free individual tutoring per week. Use the tutoring app in IRIS to arrange to work with a student tutor.    The Internet and AI  The goal of this course is to help you think and solve problems like a mathematician. It is the instructor's opinion that many uses of the Internet and most uses of AI chatbots (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) will impede your progress toward this goal. I encourage you to consider your priorities as a student in this course and, whenever tempted to try to look up answers or ask a chatbot, ask yourself \"will this help me achieve my goals, or will it short circuit the learning process?\"  It is not acceptable to turn in work copied from the Internet or generated by a chatbot; doing so constitutes a violation of the Honor Principle. Any Internet resources or chatbot sessions used to help generate a homework submission should be cited. In the case of chatbot sessions, you should include the prompt you used in your submission.  Make sure you are aware of the following two facts:   The Internet and AI chatbots are not permitted on take-home exams.    These policies are specific to this course . Consult your other instructors and their syllabi to understand if and how these resources are permitted elsewhere.       Academic accommodations  If you have a documented disability requiring academic accommodation, please have Disability & Accessibility Resources (DAR) provide a letter during the first week of classes. I will then contact you to schedule a meeting during which we can discuss your accommodations. If you believe you have an undocumented disability and that accommodations would ensure equal access to your Reed education, I would be happy to help you contact DAR.    Grades  Your grade will reflect a composite assessment of the work you produce for the class, weighted in the following fashion: 35% homework, 25% final exam, 20% exam 2, 15% exam 1, 5% class participation.    Final advice   Math is hard, but we'll get through this together!     "

  "body": " Week 1    Monday   Welcome to the Generous Arena  In What do we want a foundation to do? (2019), Penelope Maddy argues that set theory forms a Generous Arena for mathematics:  a unified setting with a Shared Standard of Proof, and a Meta-mathematical Corral so that formal techniques can be applied to all of mathematics at once.  As interesting and alive as they are, we won't pursue questions of foundations in this course. But I want to argue that topology is a Generous Arena for all — or at least nearly all — things geometric in mathematics. Given a mere whiff of geometry, some sense of closeness or continuity or paths, topology is lurking and the experience and labor of generations of mathematicians has revealed that the formalism of topology offers a common language in which these notions can be captured and made precise.  This is somewhat at odds with the common conception of topology as \"rubber sheet geometry\" — a coffee cup is the same as a donut! the Möbius strip only has one side! Euler's formula for planar graphs! Khovanov homology distinguishes the unknot! These are fine, even wonderful, topics and results, and we will discuss some of them in due course. But they do poor service in capturing the stunning breadth and extreme utility of topology in contemporary mathematics.  To make this claim concrete, here is an incomplete list of settings in which topological ideas (spaces, continuity, compactness, connectedness, homotopy, homology, and their descendants) function as a shared language:     Manifolds and singular spaces. Smooth manifolds, manifolds with boundary, orbifolds, and stratified spaces; the passage from local geometry to global invariants; and the basic fact that many geometric problems are really problems about how local pieces glue.     Configuration and moduli spaces. Spaces of points in a manifold, spaces of embeddings, and moduli of geometric structures; topology keeps track of how parameters vary continuously, and it detects global features that no coordinate chart can see.     Algebraic geometry and its avatars. Schemes as locally ringed topological spaces, complex varieties viewed as topological spaces, étale\/profinite shadows of spaces, and the way cohomology packages intersection data and subtle “hidden” structure.     Category theory as geometry. Categories as spaces (via nerves and classifying spaces), higher categories as higher-dimensional geometry, and the guiding principle that “equivalence” is often the right notion of sameness.     Dynamics and flows. Long-term behavior of iterated processes and differential equations; attractors, recurrence, and qualitative features that persist under perturbation.     Combinatorics with geometry inside. Graphs, posets, and simplicial complexes; topological invariants that constrain what combinatorial objects can exist and how they must behave.     Topological data analysis. Turning point clouds into simplicial complexes and extracting stable, noise-robust features; using homology as a kind of geometric summary statistic.     Physics and symmetry. Spaces of fields, gauge symmetry, and phase spaces; invariants arising from quantization and from the topology of symmetry actions.     Computation and invariants. Algorithms that compute topological signatures; the practical question of which invariants are computable and what they reveal (and conceal) about geometric input.     Arithmetic geometry. Number theory has its own natural topologies: the profinite Galois group  assembled from finite quotients, the -adic integers  , and the adeles  , where “closeness” is measured -adically and via local-global structure.    Our aim in this course is to build enough of the basic toolkit to recognize these phenomena when they appear, and to compute invariants that remain meaningful when coordinates, metrics, and other rigid structures are unavailable (or irrelevant).    So what is a topology?  Whatever a topology is, it is should specify a notion of convergent sequences. That is, if is a topological space (to be defined in due course) and is a sequence in , then the statement \"the limit of is \" should make sense.  Now if is Euclidean space, we know what this means:  for all there exists such that implies   where is the standard distance function on . If we focus on the role of , we'll arrive at the notion of a metric space, which is not where we're headed presently. Instead, write for the ball of points in distance less than from . We can then recast convergence of to as  for all there exists such that implies   or  for every ball centered at there exists such that implies .    This suggests that a topology on might be specified by a basis  of subsets of with similar properties to those of open balls in .    A (topological) basis on a set is a collection of subsets satisfying the following two properties:   Covering:   ; in other words, every is contained in some .    Filtered:  for all and all there exists such that .         Verify that the collection of open balls in is a basis.     Convergence with respect to a basis   Suppose is a set equipped with a basis and that is a sequence in . Then  converges to with respect to :iff for all containing there exists such that implies .     :iff  Mathematicians make a tremendous fuss about precision in language and then break all their rules when defining terms and concepts. As you know, iff is short for \"if and only if\". The colon in :iff indicates that the language to the right of :iff provides a specification for the object on the left. We will use :iff when appropriate in order to avoid the imprecision and caveats necessary for \"if\" in mathematical definitions.   Given a basis, we can define open sets :   Open sets with respect to a basis   Suppose is a set equipped with a basis . A subset is called open with respect to :iff is a union of basis sets; equivalently, there exists such that .     Nothing is open  The empty set is automatically open: . This is a computation, not a convention. Indeed, :iff there exists such that . Since there is no in , we learn that the set has no elements!    Everything is open  Recall that covers . As such, is open.    Unions of opens are open  Given open sets and where , we find that is also open since as well.   Extend the above reasoning to argue that arbitrary unions of open sets are open. Your task is to show that for any collection of open sets , the set is open as well. You may not assume that is finite; in particular, an inductive argument won't work!   Finite intersections of opens are open  It is also the case that if are open with respect to a basis , then is open with respect to as well. One can then argue by induction that any finite intersection of open sets is open.    Verify the claims of .    This leads us to the notion of a topology on a set.   Topology on a set   A topology on a set is a collection of subsets (called open sets ) that is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. A set equipped with a topology is called a topological space . We will often abuse notation and write when the topology is understood from context.     On a redundant axiom  Some authors further specify that and are open (that is, elements of ). Since and (when taking intersections of subsets of ), these conditions actually follow from closure under unions and finite intersections. Nonetheless, it is certainly important that and are open sets in every topology on ,   We have seen that every basis induces a topology by declaring the open sets to be unions of basis sets. It is also the case that every topology is a basis. We will now define sequence convergence with respect to a topology, and it will be your task to confirm that convergence with respect to a basis is the same thing as convergence with respect to the topology induced by that basis.   Open neighborhoods   Suppose is a topological space and . An open neighborhood of (with respect to ) is an open set that contains .     Sequence convergence with respect to a topology   Suppose is a topological space and is a sequence in . We say that  converges to :iff for every open neighborhood of there exists such that implies .     Sequence convergence with respect to basis versus topology  Let be a set, be a basis on , and be the topology induced by . Show that a sequence converges to with respect to the basis if and only if it converges to with respect to the topology .    Examples of topologies  It is now our lot to recite some fundamental examples of topologies. Of course, you won't really have a feel for these until you start working with topological spaces, but we have to start somewhere. The careful reader will verify that each example is indeed a topology (closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections).   Discrete topology  The discrete topology on a set is . That is, in the discrete topology, every subset of is open.    Concrete topology  The concrete topology on a set is . Other authors sometimes call this the trivial, indiscrete, or codiscrete topology.    Sierpiński space  The Sierpiński space is the set equipped with the topology . Note that this is not the discrete or concrete topology on . After developing the language of conntinuity, we will discover that for an arbitrary topological space , the continuous functions are in natural bijection with open subsets of .    Topologies on a finite set  Determine all topologies on the set . How many are there? Now do the same thing with . (You should draw a picture and it should be large and glorious. How can you organize your picture so that )  It is an open problem to determine the number of topologies on a finite set (as a function of cardinality). You can find known data and references on this problem on the OEIS .    Cofinite topology  Given a set , we can define its cofinite topology with open sets Note that if is finite, then its confinite topology is the same as the discrete topology.    The Euclidean topology on  We already discussed the open ball basis for the standard (or Euclidean ) topology on . The open sets in this topology are the arbitrary unions of open balls.    The Zariski topology on  Fix a field and natural number . Given a finite set of polynomials in variables , its vanishing locus is The Zariski topology on is In other words, is Zariski open if and only if there exist finitely many polynomials , , for which if and only if for all .    Zariski versus cofinite topologies   Let be a field.     Show that every cofinite open subset of is Zariski open.      Show that when , the cofinite and Zariski topologies on are the same.      Show that for infinite and , there are Zariski open subsets of that are not cofinite.      Poset topology Let be a poset. The poset topology on has open sets the upwards closed subsets of . This means that is open if and only if , , implies .     Wednesday      Friday     "
