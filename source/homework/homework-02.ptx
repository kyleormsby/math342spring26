      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that the squaring map
          <md>
            <mrow>s\colon (-1,0)\cup [1,2) \amp \longrightarrow (0,4) </mrow>
            <mrow>x \amp \longmapsto x^2</mrow>
          </md>
          is a continuous bijection which is not a homeomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>\mathbb R\smallsetminus \{0\}\to \mathbb R</m>, <m>x\mapsto 1/x</m> is continuous but 
          admits no continuous extension to a map with domain <m>\mathbb R</m>. (Part of your task is to make 
          the meaning of this prompt precise. As much as possible, use "preimage of an open is open" language 
          in your proof, as opposed to <m>\varepsilon</m>-<m>\delta</m> language.)

      <statement>
        <p>
          Rigorously prove that <m>\mathrm{SO}(2)</m> is homeomorphic to <m>S^1</m>. Here <m>\mathrm{SO}(2) = \mathrm{SO}_2(\mathbb R)</m> 
          the set of <m>2\times 2</m> real orthogonal matrices with determinant <m>1</m> given the subspace topology inside 
          <m>\mathbb R^{2\times 2}</m>, and <m>S^1</m> is the unit circle given the subspace topology inside <m>\mathbb R^2</m>. You may 
          freely use the fact that every element of <m>\mathrm{SO}(2)</m> is of the form 
          <m>
            \begin{pmatrix}
              \cos \theta \amp -\sin \theta\\
              \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta
            \end{pmatrix}
          </m> for <m>\theta</m> some real number.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a morphism <m>f\colon x\to y</m> in a category <m>\mathsf C</m>. Prove the following statement:
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              if there exist morphisms <m>g,h\colon y\rightrightarrows x</m> such that <m>gf=\operatorname{id}_x</m> and 
              <m>gf=\operatorname{id}_y</m>, then <m>g=h</m> and <m>f</m> is an isomorphism.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          Conclude that two-sided compositional inverses in a category are unique.

        <statement>
          <p>
          Prove that functors preserve isomorphisms, <ie />, if <m>F\colon \mathsf C\to \mathsf D</m> is a functor and <m>f</m> is an 
          isomorhism in <m>\mathsf C</m>, then <m>Ff</m> is an isomorphism in <m>\mathsf D</m>.

        <p>
          Give an example of a functor that does 
          not <term>refelct isomorphisms</term>; that is, find categories <m>\mathsf C</m>, <m>\mathsf D</m>, a functor
          <m>F\colon \mathsf C\to \mathsf D</m>, and a morphism <m>f</m> of <m>\mathsf C</m> for which <m>Ff</m> is an isomorphism but 
          <m>f</m> is not.
