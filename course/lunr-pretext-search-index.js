Class meetings  MWF 14:40-15:30 in Eliot 207    Office hours  Tu 13:00-14:00 & Th 14:30-15:30 in Lib 306 and by appointment     Zulip workspace   math342-2026.zulipchat.com        Course description  Topology is the study of properties of spaces and maps that are invariant under continuous deformation — the qualitative geometry captured by notions like continuity, convergence, compactness, and connectedness rather than by distances or angles. In this course we will build a rigorous foundation for these ideas and then use it as a common language for a range of modern examples, with particular attention to configuration spaces and moduli spaces, manifolds and their local-to-global structure, and profinite spaces that arise as inverse limits and in “arithmetic” topological contexts. We will also introduce homology as a first bridge from point-set foundations to algebraic topology, using it to extract computable invariants and to illuminate how spaces are built. Along the way we will emphasize categorical perspectives — functoriality, universal properties, and adjointness — as tools for organizing constructions and revealing the relationships among these different kinds of spaces.    Learning outcomes  Here are the overarching goals of the course:   Converse in the languages of topology and category theory.    Utilize universal properties and concrete constructions to define mathematical objects and manipulate them.    Understand and utilize theorems and concepts from topology such as connectedness, compactness, Hausdorffness, Tychonoff's theorem, one-point and Stone-Čech compactifications, homology, and Mayer-Vietoris sequence.    Understand and utilize theorems and concepts from category theory such as functors, natural transformations, the Yoneda lemma, (co)limits, and adjunctions.    Understand and produce proofs related to the above topics.    Apply the above topics in relevant examples and applications.    Communicate mathematical ideas verbally and in writing.       Distribution requirements  This course can be used towards your Group III, \"Natural, Mathematical, and Psychological Science,\" requirement. It accomplishes the following goals for the group:   Use and evaluate quantitative data or modeling, or use logical\/mathematical reasoning to evaluate, test, or prove statements.    Given a problem or question, formulate a hypothesis or conjecture, and design an experiment, collect data or use mathematical reasoning to test or validate it.     This course does not satisfy the \"primary data collection and analysis\" requirement.    Texts  This course does not have an assigned textbook, but I recommend Topology (2nd ed.) by James Munkres and Topology: A Categorical Approach as supplementary texts. I will be writing course notes during the term which will appear on this website.    Homework  Homework will be posted on the course website and should be submitted via Gradescope every Friday by 10pm. Homework due Friday of week covers topics through Monday of week and you are strongly encouraged to start the homework early in order to take advantage of office hours and study groups. Excellent solutions take many forms, but they all have the following characteristics:   they are written as explanations for other students in the course; in particular, they fully explain all of their reasoning and do not assume that the reader will fill in details;    when graphical reasoning is called for, they include large, carefully drawn and labeled diagrams;    they are neatly written or typeset; and    they use complete sentences, even when formulas or symbols are involved.   Given the exigences of contemporary existence, students may take advantage of up to three weekend extensions on homework assignments over the course of the semester. To do so, you must contact the instructor before the deadline and request an extension. No explanation is needed, and you will automatically receive an extension till the following Monday at 10pm. In extreme circumstances, I may make additional accommodations; early and clear communication is key.    Collaboration  You are permitted and encouraged to work with your peers on homework problems. You must cite those with whom you worked, and you must write up solutions independently. Duplicated solutions will not be accepted and constitute a violation of the Honor Principle.    Feedback  You will receive timely feedback on your homework via Gradescope, either from me or the course grader (a mathematics undergraduate). Each homework problem can earn up to five points for mathematical content, and two points for the quality of writing. If your answer is incorrect, this will be reflected in the score, and there will also be a comment indicating where things went wrong with your solution. You are strongly encouraged to engage with this comment, understand your error, and try to come up with a correct solution. You are very welcome to post questions about old homework problems to the Zulip workspace (see below) and talk about them with me in office hours (see the Help section).    Exams  We will have two midterm exams and a final exam. The midterm exams will be open book, open notes, and take-home. They will have suggested time constraints and firm due dates, but you will be permitted to spend an arbitrary amount of time on the problems between when the exam is distributed and collected. Calculators, computers, phones, collaboration, the Internet, and chat bots \/ AI are prohibited during exams.  The final exam will be an oral exam. Questions related to those asked during the exam will be distributed beforehand.   Midterm Exam 1  TBD    Midterm Exam 2  TBD    Final Exam  Individual 30-minute time slots scheduled during finals week, May 11-14.       Joint expectations  As members of a communal learning environment, we should all expect consideration, fairness, patience, and curiosity from each other. Our aim is to all learn more through cooperation and genuine listening and sharing, not to compete or show off. I expect diligence and academic and intellectual honesty from each of you. You should expect that I will do my best to focus the course on interesting, pertinent topics, and that I will provide feedback and guidance which will help you excel as a student.    Zulip  This course will use a Zulip workspace for asynchronous communication. Use the Zulip workspace to ask questions (of me or the class), collaborate on problems, and share resources. The Zulip workspace is an extension of our classroom and the above joint expectations extend to this setting.  You will receive an email invitation to join our Zulip workspace during the first week of classes. Please use channels and threads to keep conversations organized.    Help  Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend my office hours 13:00-14:00 Tuesday and Thursday each week. These are an opportunity to discuss course content, get help on homework problems, or dig deeper into material. You can also schedule a one-on-one appointment with me via this link .  Additionally, every Reed student is entitled to one hour of free individual tutoring per week. Use the tutoring app in IRIS to arrange to work with a student tutor.    The Internet and AI  The goal of this course is to help you think and solve problems like a mathematician. It is the instructor's opinion that many uses of the Internet and most uses of AI chatbots (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) will impede your progress toward this goal. I encourage you to consider your priorities as a student in this course and, whenever tempted to try to look up answers or ask a chatbot, ask yourself \"will this help me achieve my goals, or will it short circuit the learning process?\"  It is not acceptable to turn in work copied from the Internet or generated by a chatbot; doing so constitutes a violation of the Honor Principle. Any Internet resources or chatbot sessions used to help generate a homework submission should be cited. In the case of chatbot sessions, you should include the prompt you used in your submission.  Make sure you are aware of the following two facts:   The Internet and AI chatbots are not permitted on take-home exams.    These policies are specific to this course . Consult your other instructors and their syllabi to understand if and how these resources are permitted elsewhere.       Academic accommodations  If you have a documented disability requiring academic accommodation, please have Disability & Accessibility Resources (DAR) provide a letter during the first week of classes. I will then contact you to schedule a meeting during which we can discuss your accommodations. If you believe you have an undocumented disability and that accommodations would ensure equal access to your Reed education, I would be happy to help you contact DAR.    Grades  Your grade will reflect a composite assessment of the work you produce for the class, weighted in the following fashion: 35% homework, 25% final exam, 20% exam 2, 15% exam 1, 5% class participation.    Final advice   Math is hard, but we'll get through this together!     "

  "body": " Week 1    Monday   Welcome to the Generous Arena  In What do we want a foundation to do? (2019), Penelope Maddy argues that set theory forms a Generous Arena for mathematics:  a unified setting with a Shared Standard of Proof, and a Meta-mathematical Corral so that formal techniques can be applied to all of mathematics at once.  As interesting and alive as they are, we won't pursue questions of foundations in this course. But I want to argue that topology is a Generous Arena for all — or at least nearly all — things geometric in mathematics. Given a mere whiff of geometry, some sense of closeness or continuity or paths, topology is lurking and the experience and labor of generations of mathematicians has revealed that the formalism of topology offers a common language in which these notions can be captured and made precise.  This is somewhat at odds with the common conception of topology as \"rubber sheet geometry\" — a coffee cup is the same as a donut! the Möbius strip only has one side! Euler's formula for planar graphs! Khovanov homology distinguishes the unknot! These are fine, even wonderful, topics and results, and we will discuss some of them in due course. But they do poor service in capturing the stunning breadth and extreme utility of topology in contemporary mathematics.  To make this claim concrete, here is an incomplete list of settings in which topological ideas (spaces, continuity, compactness, connectedness, homotopy, homology, and their descendants) function as a shared language:     Manifolds and singular spaces. Smooth manifolds, manifolds with boundary, orbifolds, and stratified spaces; the passage from local geometry to global invariants; and the basic fact that many geometric problems are really problems about how local pieces glue.     Configuration and moduli spaces. Spaces of points in a manifold, spaces of embeddings, and moduli of geometric structures; topology keeps track of how parameters vary continuously, and it detects global features that no coordinate chart can see.     Algebraic geometry and its avatars. Schemes as locally ringed topological spaces, complex varieties viewed as topological spaces, étale\/profinite shadows of spaces, and the way cohomology packages intersection data and subtle “hidden” structure.     Category theory as geometry. Categories as spaces (via nerves and classifying spaces), higher categories as higher-dimensional geometry, and the guiding principle that “equivalence” is often the right notion of sameness.     Dynamics and flows. Long-term behavior of iterated processes and differential equations; attractors, recurrence, and qualitative features that persist under perturbation.     Combinatorics with geometry inside. Graphs, posets, and simplicial complexes; topological invariants that constrain what combinatorial objects can exist and how they must behave.     Topological data analysis. Turning point clouds into simplicial complexes and extracting stable, noise-robust features; using homology as a kind of geometric summary statistic.     Physics and symmetry. Spaces of fields, gauge symmetry, and phase spaces; invariants arising from quantization and from the topology of symmetry actions.     Computation and invariants. Algorithms that compute topological signatures; the practical question of which invariants are computable and what they reveal (and conceal) about geometric input.     Arithmetic geometry. Number theory has its own natural topologies: the profinite Galois group  assembled from finite quotients, the -adic integers  , and the adeles  , where “closeness” is measured -adically and via local-global structure.    Our aim in this course is to build enough of the basic toolkit to recognize these phenomena when they appear, and to compute invariants that remain meaningful when coordinates, metrics, and other rigid structures are unavailable (or irrelevant).    So what is a topology?  Whatever a topology is, it is should specify a notion of convergent sequences. That is, if is a topological space (to be defined in due course) and is a sequence in , then the statement \"the limit of is \" should make sense.  Now if is Euclidean space, we know what this means:  for all there exists such that implies   where is the standard distance function on . If we focus on the role of , we'll arrive at the notion of a metric space, which is not where we're headed presently. Instead, write for the ball of points in distance less than from . We can then recast convergence of to as  for all there exists such that implies   or  for every ball centered at there exists such that implies .    This suggests that a topology on might be specified by a basis  of subsets of with similar properties to those of open balls in .    A (topological) basis on a set is a collection of subsets satisfying the following two properties:   Covering:   ; in other words, every is contained in some .    Filtered:  for all and all there exists such that .         Verify that the collection of open balls in is a basis.     Convergence with respect to a basis   Suppose is a set equipped with a basis and that is a sequence in . Then  converges to with respect to :iff for all containing there exists such that implies .     :iff  Mathematicians make a tremendous fuss about precision in language and then break all their rules when defining terms and concepts. As you know, iff is short for \"if and only if\". The colon in :iff indicates that the language to the right of :iff provides a specification for the object on the left. We will use :iff when appropriate in order to avoid the imprecision and caveats necessary for \"if\" in mathematical definitions.   Given a basis, we can define open sets :   Open sets with respect to a basis   Suppose is a set equipped with a basis . A subset is called open with respect to :iff is a union of basis sets; equivalently, there exists such that .     Nothing is open  The empty set is automatically open: . This is a computation, not a convention. Indeed, :iff there exists such that . Since there is no in , we learn that the set has no elements!    Everything is open  Recall that covers . As such, is open.    Unions of opens are open  Given open sets and where , we find that is also open since as well.    Arbitrary unions of opens are open  Extend the above reasoning to argue that arbitrary unions of open sets are open. Your task is to show that for any collection of open sets , the set is open as well. You may not assume that is finite; in particular, an inductive argument won't work!    Finite intersections of opens are open  It is also the case that if are open with respect to a basis , then is open with respect to as well. One can then argue by induction that any finite intersection of open sets is open.    Verify the claims of .    This leads us to the notion of a topology on a set.   Topology on a set   A topology on a set is a collection of subsets (called open sets ) that is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. A set equipped with a topology is called a topological space . We will often abuse notation and write when the topology is understood from context.     On a redundant axiom  Some authors further specify that and are open (that is, elements of ). Since and (when taking intersections of subsets of ), these conditions actually follow from closure under unions and finite intersections. Nonetheless, it is certainly important that and are open sets in every topology on .   We have seen that every basis induces a topology by declaring the open sets to be unions of basis sets. It is also the case that every topology is a basis. We will now define sequence convergence with respect to a topology, and it will be your task to confirm that convergence with respect to a basis is the same thing as convergence with respect to the topology induced by that basis.   Open neighborhoods   Suppose is a topological space and . An open neighborhood of (with respect to ) is an open set that contains .     Sequence convergence with respect to a topology   Suppose is a topological space and is a sequence in . We say that  converges to :iff for every open neighborhood of there exists such that implies .     Sequence convergence with respect to basis versus topology  Let be a set, be a basis on , and be the topology generated by . Show that a sequence converges to with respect to the basis if and only if it converges to with respect to the topology .    Examples of topologies  It is now our lot to recite some fundamental examples of topologies. Of course, you won't really have a feel for these until you start working with topological spaces, but we have to start somewhere. The careful reader will verify that each example is indeed a topology (closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections).   Discrete topology  The discrete topology on a set is . That is, in the discrete topology, every subset of is open.    Concrete topology  The concrete topology on a set is . Other authors sometimes call this the trivial, indiscrete, or codiscrete topology.    Sierpiński space  The Sierpiński space is the set equipped with the topology . Note that this is not the discrete or concrete topology on . After developing the language of continuity, we will discover that for an arbitrary topological space , the continuous functions are in natural bijection with open subsets of .    Topologies on a finite set  Determine all topologies on the set . How many are there? Now do the same thing with . (You should draw a picture and it should be large and glorious. How can you organize your picture so that it demonstrates important relations between topologies?)  It is an open problem to determine the number of topologies on a finite set (as a function of cardinality). You can find known data and references on this problem on the OEIS .    Cofinite topology  Given a set , we can define its cofinite topology with open sets Note that if is finite, then its confinite topology is the same as the discrete topology.    The Euclidean topology on  We already discussed the open ball basis for the standard (or Euclidean ) topology on . The open sets in this topology are the arbitrary unions of open balls.    The Zariski topology on  Fix a field and natural number . Given a finite set of polynomials in variables , its vanishing locus is The Zariski topology on is In other words, is Zariski open if and only if there exist finitely many polynomials , , for which if and only if for some .    Zariski versus cofinite topologies   Let be a field.     Show that every cofinite open subset of is Zariski open.      Show that when , the cofinite and Zariski topologies on are the same.      Show that for infinite and , there are Zariski open subsets of that are not cofinite.      Poset topology  Let be a poset. The poset topology on has open sets the upwards closed subsets of . This means that is open if and only if , , implies .    Subspace topology  Let be a topological space and let be a subset. The subspace topology on has open sets of the form where is open. This is a very powerful construction that allows us to induce topologies on all manner of things. For instance, open intervals receive a topology in this way, as do open balls and the unit sphere If we do not specify otherwise, a subset of a topological space will always be endowed with the subspace topology.  Here's a fun way to produce interesting (sub)spaces: first, endow the real matrices with the Euclidean topoology (considering a matrix as the vector ). Inside of we have the matrix groups of special orthogonal, orthogonal, and invertible (general linear) matrices. We will consider each as a subspace of k, producing a rich family of topological spaces.  As a special case, consider . These matrices encode rotations about the origin in the plane. Once we have introduced the concepts of continuity and homeomorphism, we will argue that is \"the same as\" (homeomorphic to) ,        Wednesday   Continuity  Given sets , we are familiar with functions as a mechanism for comparing and . If and are topological spaces, then only some functions \"respect\" their topology; we call these continuous functions. Before introducing the formal definition of continuity, let's motivate it in terms of familiar - continuity:  A function is continuous at a point in its domain :iff  for all there exists such that implies .  We are currently interested in functions continuous everywhere, so the above condition must hold for all . Of course, is permitted to depend on both and .  Phrased in terms of the basic open sets of , that is, open balls, we see that for every and every open ball centered at , there exists an open ball centered at such that ; equivalently, .   Every function induces a direct image function and preimage function  given by and .   We can further recast - continuity as follows:  for every in the domain and every basic open of the codomain with , there exists a basic open of the domain such that and .  Now consider some . By continuity, there exists a basic open of the domain for which and . From this, we may conclude that (You should check the details.) Thus is open. Observe that every open set is a union of basic opens, whence we get another equivalent condition for continuity:  for every basic open of the codomain, is open in the domain.  And once again, every open is a union of basic opens, and preimage commutes with unions, we we can simply say that the preimage of every open is open. This is our formal definition of continuity in the context of general topological spaces:   Continuity   A function between topological spaces is continuous :iff for every open subset , the preimage is open in .    In order to develop our intuition for continuity, we'll introduce some additional terminology:  Closed subsets   A subset of a topological space is closed :iff for some open set .      Topologies via closed sets  Prove that the closed subsets of a topological space are closed under arbitrary intersection and finite union. Then verify that a family of subsets closed under arbitrary intersection and finite union specifies a topology by declaring to be open if and only if it is the complement of some set in .   Since and are always open subsets of a topological space , we see that and are always closed subsets of . In this fashion, we see that \"open\" and \"closed\" are not antonyms in topology — they are properties that can be simultaneously obtained. When a set is both open and closed, we may exercise questionable taste and call it clopen .   Interior and closure   Let be a space and be a subset. The interior of , denoted , is the maximal open subset of ; the closure of , denoted , is the minimal closed subset of containing .     Constructing interiors and closures  Prove that for a subset of a space ,     Continuity in terms of interiors and closures  Show that a function between topological spaces in continuous if and only if for all subsets , . Show that continuity is also equivalent to the condition that for all subsets , .   With a good notion of continuity in hand, we are now ready to specify what it means for two spaces to be the \"same\" --- structurally if not literally.   Homeomorphism   Given topological spaces , a continuous function is a homeomorphism :iff it has a continuous two-sided inverse . Two spaces are called homeomorphic :iff a homeomorphism exists; in this case, we write or or .    Here is an important theorem that will help you solve the ensuing exercise.   Compositions of continuous functions are continuous   Suppose and are continuous functions between topological spaces. Then the composite function is continuous as well.     Suppose is open. Since is continuous, is an open subset of . Since is continuous, is an open subset of . One may check that This shows that is an open subset of . Since was an arbitrary open subset of , we deduce that is continuous.    Homeomorphism is an equivalence relation  Momentarily pretend there is such a thing as the \"set\" of all topological spaces. Prove that homeomorphism is an equivalence relation on .   It is now high time for some examples.   Identities are homeomorphisms  The identity function is a homeomorphism. This is because is continuous and its inverse is .    Every function from a discrete space is continuous  Write for a set endowed with the discrete topology . If is some other topological space and is an arbitrary function, then is continuous. Indeed, if is open, then is open since all subsets of a discrete space are open.    Continuous bijections need not be homeomorphisms  For a set , consider the identity function This is a continuous bijection, but its inverse is not continuous unless . (Check this!)  For a more geometric example, consider the function This is a continuous bijection, but the inverse rends the circle at . To see why this fails the formal definition of continuity, note that is open, but its preimage is not open.    Open intervals and  The open interval is homemorphic to every other open interval with via which is continuous with continuous inverse All open intervals are also homeomorphic to . Indeed, are inverse continuous functions (where for the second map, we define ).    Beware that we have not yet verified the continuity of these maps. Rather than undertaking laborious verifications presently, we will return and make this check after we have developed some helpful rules on how we may combine continuous functions while preserving continuity.     Topological properties  Historically, topological properties preceded topology. Mathematicians noticed that certain properties — such as nonemptiness, connectedness, discreteness, and compactness — did not change under a broad class of deformations. In order codify these properties, they then created the language of topology, continuity, and homeomorphisms.   Topological property   Let be a property that may or may not be obtained by each topological space. Call a topological property :iff In other words, a property is a topological property if and only if it is homeomorphism invariant.     Cardinality is a topological property  If , then a homeomorphism is necessarily a bijection, whence the cardinalities of and are equal: .    Cardinality of the topology is a topological property  Prove that implies .   Much of this course will develop additional topological properties, such as (path) connectivity, connectedness, the (isomorphism type of the) fundamental group, and the (isomorphism type of) homology.    Building continuous functions  Our task now is to assemble a toolkit that will allow us to build new continuous functions from old ones. These notes will prove a few of the statements, you will prove a few in your homework, and the rest will be left for personal verification or faith. Recall that in we have already verified that composition preserves continuity, and in we learned that identity functions (from a space to the same space) are continuous.   New continuous maps from old   Let be topological spaces.    Constant maps  Fix . Then the constant map is continuous.    Open inclusions  Let be an open subset. The inclusion map is continuous.    Into an open  Let be open and let be a function. If the composite is continuous, then so is .    Check on closed sets  A function is continuous if and only if the preimage of every closed subset of is closed.    Locality  Let be a function. Suppose that for each there exists an open subset for which is continuous. Then is continuous.    Gluing  Suppose , where and are both open subsets (or, alternatively, both closed subsets) of . Give and the subspace topology and suppose that is a function whose restrictions to and are continuous. Then is continuous.       We will only verify locality and the open case of gluing and leave the other properties as exercises. Locality first: Suppose that satisfies the hypotheses of locality and let be an open subset. Then is open for all . Furthermore, since the cover . Since arbitrary unions of open sets are open, we conclude that is open. Since was an arbitrary open subset, this demonstrates that is continuous.  Now for gluing when are open: Let be open. Then —(by hypothesis and the definition of the subspace topology — is open in and is open in . Thus for some open set and for some open set ; as the finite intersection of open subsets of , we conclude that and are open in . Since , we see that is the union of open subsets of and hence open. Since was an arbitrary open subset, this verifies that is continuous.   Many of our constructions of topological spaces will come equipped with methods for identifying continuous maps either in or out of the space. For the moment, we will content ourselves with a discussion of how one might verify continuity from general principles instead of via the raw definition.   Breaking down continuity  Suppose you want to show that is continuous. Come up with a roadmap of general lemmata you might try to prove in service of deducing continuity of this map. We will discuss your roadmap in class and determine if it can work.   You probably want addition and multiplication to be continuous. And it would also be nice if continuity after projection to each factor implied continuity of the original map.     Build your own continuous function  Define an interesting function (or perhaps with a different codomain). Come up with a criterion that you hope will test whether your function is continuous in terms of a related function from a closed interval to (or your alternate codomain).   What can you do with , ?    Once we develop the product and quotient topologies, we will be able to vet your guesses in the above exercises.     Friday  We finished up most of the Wednesday material during this class meeting.   "

  "title": "Week 2",
  "body": " Week 2   Monday   Topology from the categorical viewpoint   One of my favorite math books is John Milnor's Topology from the differentiable viewpoint , which serves as inspiration for the the section title here.   One of the primary insights of twentieth century mathematics is that objects should not be studied in isolation. Rather, to understand objects we must also understand relationships between objects. Topologies offer one notion of “relation”, organizing the points of a set into neighborhoods. As an abstraction of geometry, topology is immensely successful, but it fails to capture a second, more structural notion of relation.   Category theory organizes objects by their transformations. Once these notions of object and relation are abstracted, it becomes possible to compare and contrast different fields of mathematics. Theorems about wildly different mathematical objects are often identical in their categorical content. In this manner, category theory becomes a meta-mathematical tool for both identifying and conjecturing structural results.  Our present goal is to use the language of category theory to motivate definitions and interpret theorems. Moving into the algebro-topological portion of the course, this language will become even more important as we use the homology functor to compare the categories of topological spaces and vector spaces.    Categories  We begin with a motivating example. Sets are a type of mathematical object. Sets are related by functions. Each function has a domain (source) and codomain (target). In standard notation, denotes a function with domain and codomain . Of course, functions admit composition: given and we can form by assigning to . This composition is associative: if , , and are functions, then   Moreover, each set (even the empty set!) admits an identity function . This function takes each to and satisfies the following property: for each and each ,     In the following definition, we will see that categories consist of objects, morphisms (with source and target objects), composition, and identity morphisms satisfying associativity and identity properties. As such, sets and functions form our first example of a category.    A category  consists of a collection of objects  and a collection of morphisms  along with assignments (called the source and target maps). Let denote the collection of morphisms with source and target . Then for each , is also equipped with a composition    Additionally, for each there is an identity morphism  . This data must satisfy the following properties:    Associativity:  For objects and morphisms , , and , we have     Identity:  For each , , and , we have       It is useful to think about categories diagrammatically. These diagrams use letters to represent objects, and labelled arrows to represent morphisms. So if and , we may draw an arrow from to labelled in order to represent that is a morphism with source and target . (Note that we have dropped from our notation here: usually it will be clear from context which category we are working in.) We may also write to represent .  Now suppose that in addition to we also have a morphism . Composition tells us that we then get a new morphism . We can put all of this information into a single commutative diagram .      graph={0:[1,2], 1:[2]}   x  y  z  f  g  g\\circ f      A triangle with objects , , and arrows , , and . The arrows form a triangle with indicated sources and targets.  0 When we say that a diagram like the one above commutes , we are saying precisely that the two paths from to determine the same morphism, i.e. the bottom arrow equals the composite of the two slanted arrows. The geometric presentation of the diagram is unimportant; we can rearrange the nodes without changing the meaning.  We can also use diagrams to express the axioms for a category. Associativity can be pictured as the statement that two different ways of composing , , and agree.      graph={0:[1,2], 1:[2,3], 2:[3]}    x  y  z  w   f  g  h   g\\circ f  h\\circ g      A four-object diagram showing arrows , , and the composites , .   We can interpret this axiom as saying that we can paste together commutative triangles to produce commutative quadrilaterals. The identity axiom also admits a simple diagrammatic expression.       graph={0:[1,2], 1:[2]}    x  x  x  \\operatorname{id}_x  f  f      A triangle expressing .       graph={0:[1,2], 1:[2]}    y  x  x  g  \\operatorname{id}_x  g      A triangle expressing .    Without realizing it, you have been working with categories for a long time. Consider the following examples.   The category of sets and functions   We have already mentioned that sets and functions form a category. We denote this category . Similarly, there is a category with objects finite sets and morphisms functions between finite sets.     The category of vector spaces and linear transformations   Let be a field and let have objects -vector spaces and morphisms -linear transformations. Since linear transformations compose (in the set-theoretic sense) to give new linear transformations, is also a category. (It is obvious that the identity function is linear.) We can also consider the category of finite-dimensional -vector spaces and -linear transformations.     The empty category   The empty category  has no objects (i.e. ) and no morphisms ( ). The source, target, and composition functions are all the empty function and all properties are satisfied vacuously!     The trivial category   The trivial category  has a singleton set for its objects and a single morphism (necessarily the identity on ), . The only composition to define is and this is enough to check the associativity and identity properties as well.     A category whose morphisms are not functions   Not every category has special classes of functions as morphisms. Consider whose objects are the natural numbers and whose morphisms are matrices with entries in a field . Composition is given by matrix multiplication (check compatibility!) and is the identity matrix. Since matrix multiplication is associative, this forms a category.  If you are suspicious that this category is eerily similar to , worry not: it is! After studying equivalences of categories and skeleta, you will understand exactly how similar.    The following two examples should seem completely obvious if you have already taken a course in abstract algebra. If you have not, there is no harm in skipping them.   Categories of groups   There are categories , , and of groups, finite groups, and Abelian groups, respectively. In each case, morphisms are group homomorphisms.     Categories of rings   There are categories and of rings and commutative rings, respectively. In both cases, morphisms are ring homomorphisms. There is also a category of fields and field homomorphisms.    Finally, we come to the category of primary interest in this course, the category of topological spaces and continuous functions.   The category of topological spaces and continuous functions   The category has topological spaces as its objects and continuous functions as its morphisms. In order to check this, we must see that the composition of continuous functions is continuous and that identity functions are continuous. If is a topological space and is the identity function, then for any open, is open in , so is continuous. The associativity and identity axioms hold because they hold for functions.     Choice of morphisms  Of course, there is also a category whose objects are topological spaces and morphisms are arbitrary functions between underlying sets. And while we are free to define such a category, it is not of particular interest. A category is a tool for studying relationships between objects. If we choose the wrong set of relationships (i.e. the wrong morphisms), then we end up with an uninteresting — or, worse yet, misleading — category.     Functors  If category theory is all about relations between mathematical objects, and categories are themselves mathematical objects then we need a way to compare — or relate — categories. This is what functors do.    A functor from a category to a category , denoted is an assignment on objects together with an assignment on morphisms for each satisfying the following properties:   for all , , and    for every pair of composable morphisms , ,         The direct image functor  There are multiple functors associated with the power set construction . Our first example is direct image, which takes and . You should check that the identity function maps to the identity on power sets, and that direct image commutes with composition, , .      Wednesday   More on functors  Some functors \"reverse arrows\". For instance, preimages famously satisfy . To handle this formally, we make the following definition.   Opposite category   Given a category , its opposite category  has the same objects as and . Composition in is given by composing in the swapped order in , and identities are the same as in .     Verify that is a category.   A functor that \"reverses arrows\" can now be encoded as a functor . Some authors call this a contravariant functor  , but we will try to avoid this language here.   The preimage functor  The power set construction on objects also admits preimage as its functorial assignment on morphisms. That is, there is a functor given by    Functors are fantastic tools. One thing you can do with them is prove existence results like the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. A fixed point of a function is a point for which .   Brouwer fixed-point theorem   Let denote the closed unit disk in Euclidean -space for some . Then every continuous function has a fixed point.     Let be a continuous function and suppose for contradiction that does not admit a fixed point. Then there is a well-defined continuous function taking to the unique point on through which the ray from to passes. (Can you prove that this is continuous?) Since it will be important momentarily, note that the restriction of to is the identity map.  Later, we will introduce a functor called homology . The -th homology functor from spaces to Abelian groups has something to do with \" -dimensional holes\" and, in particular, we will compute Since the restriction of to is the identity, we know that the diagram  A commutative diagram with at upper left and upper right, and at the bottom. Arrows: from the left to the right ; from the left down to ; and from up to the right .     graph={0:[1,2], 1:[2]}   S^{n-1}  D^n  S^{n-1}  \\operatorname{id}  \\operatorname{inc}  g      commutes. Applying , it follows that the diagram  A commutative diagram with at upper left and upper right, and at the bottom. Arrows: from the left to the right ; from the left down to ; and from up to the right .     graph={0:[1,2], 1:[2]}   H_{n-1}S^{n-1}  0  H_{n-1}S^{n-1}  \\operatorname{id}  H_{n-1}\\operatorname{inc}  H_{n-1}g      commutes. This is a contradiction since the identity map between nonzero Abelian groups does not factor through the trivial group! We conclude that a fixed point must exist after all.     New topologies from old We now undertake the construction of new topological spaces from old ones, with a focus on the subspace, product, coproduct, and quotient topologies. Later, we will also talk about function spaces.   The subspace topology  Given a space and subset , we have already defined the subspace topology on . It has open sets of the form where is open.  But why did we make this definition? What does the subspace topology on do for us that other topologies do not?  To answer this question, we will extend our notion of \"subspace\" a bit and develop its universal property in categorical language. In fact, this is the start of a general pattern we will follow when constructing new spaces:   Universal property  Say what we want the space to do in a way that specifies the construction up to unique homeomorphism.    Construction  Provide a concrete desciption of the space and verify that it satisfies the universal property.    Examples  Get familiar with the space, universal property, and construction by playing with well-chosen examples.        Friday     "
